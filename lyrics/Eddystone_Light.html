<pre>
My father was the keeper of the Eddystone light
And he slept with a mermaid one fine night
And of that union there came three
A porgy and a porpoise and the other was me
 <i>
 Yo ho ho, the wind blows free
 Oh for a life on the rolling sea
 </i>
Late one night when I was a trimmin’ of the glim
And singing a verse of the evening hymn
A voice from the starboard shouted “Ahoy”
And there was my mother, sitting on a buoy

“Oh what has become of my children three?”
My mother then she asked of me
“Oh, one was exhibited as a talking fish
The other was served on a chafing dish”

The phosphorus flashed in her seaweed hair
I looked again and my mother wasn’t there
A voice came echoing out of the night
“To hell with the keeper of the Eddystone Light!”
