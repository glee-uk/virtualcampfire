 Froggy Went A-Courtin’

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Froggy went a courtin’ and he did ride, a-hum
Froggy went a courtin’ and he did ride, a-hum, a-hum
Froggy went a courtin’ and he did ride
A sword and pistol by his side
A-hum, a-hum, a-hum, a-hum

Came up to Missie Mouse’s door, a-hum...
Where he’d often been before...

Missie Mouse are you within? A-hum...
Yes kind sir and please do come in...

Missie Mouse will you marry me? a-hum...
O no kind sir that never can be...

Without my Uncle Rat’s consent, a-hum...
I would not marry the President...

Uncle Rat laughed till he split his sides, a-hum...
To think his niece would be a bride...

Where will the wedding breakfast be? A-hum...
Way down yonder in the hollow tree...

What will the wedding breakfast be? A-hum
Two red beans and a black-eyed pea...

So they all went swimming across the lake, a-hum...
And got swallowed up by a big black snake...
