 Come Landlord Fill The Flowing Bowl

Three jolly coachmen sat in an English tavern
Three jolly coachmen sat in an English tavern
And they decided, and they decided, and they decided
To have another flagon
 <i>
    Come landlord fill the flowing bowl until it doth run over
    Come landlord fill the flowing bowl until it doth run over
    For tonight we’ll merry merry be
    For tonight we’ll merry merry be
    For tonight we’ll merry merry be
    Tomorrow we’ll be sober
 </i>
Here’s to the man drinks water pure and goes to bed quite sober
Here’s to the man drinks water pure and goes to bed quite sober
Falls as the leaves do fall
Falls as the leaves do fall
Falls as the leaves do fall
He’ll die before October

Here’s to the man who drinks strong ale and goes to
bed quite mellow...
Lives as he ought to live...
And dies a jolly good fellow

 Here’s to the maid who steals a kiss and runs to tell
her mother...
She’s a foolish, foolish thing...
She’ll never get another
Here’s to the maid who steals a kiss and comes back
for another...
She’s a boon for all mankind...
She’ll very soon be a mother
