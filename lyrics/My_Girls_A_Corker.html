 My Girls A Corker
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
My girl’s a corker, she’s a New Yorker
I’d give her anything to keep her in style
She’s got a pair of feet, just like two plates of meat
Yes sir, that how the money goes, Ta, ra, ra
Umpah, umpah, umpah-pah
Stick it up your jumpah-pah

She’s got a pair of legs just like two whisky kegs

She’s got a pair of hips just like two battleships

She’s got a pair of arms just like two waving palms

She’s got a pair of eyes just like two custard pies

She’s got a nose just like a garden hose

She’s got a mop of hair just like a grizzly bear

My girl’s a corker, she’s a New Yorker
I’d give her anything to keep her in style
She wears silk underwear, I wear my latest pair
Yes sir, that how the money goes, Ta, ra, ra..
