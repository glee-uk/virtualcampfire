  My name is Jock Stewart and I’m a canny young man
  And a rambling young fellow I’ve been
  So be easy and free when you’re drinking with me
  I’m a man you don’t meet every day

  I’ve got acres of land, I have men to command
  And I’ve always a shilling to spare
  So be easy and free when you’re drinking with me
  I’m a man you don’t meet every day
  <i>
  Come fill up your glasses of brandy or wine
  And whatever the cost I will pay
  So be easy and free when you’re drinking with me
  I’m a man you don’t meet every day
  </i>

  I take out my dog and with him I do shoot
  All by the River Kildare
  So be easy and free when you’re drinking with me
  I’m a man you don’t meet every day
