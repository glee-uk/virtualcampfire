 Red River Valley

<pre>
From this valley they say you are going
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine
That has brightened our pathways a while
 <i>
 Come and sit by my side if you love me
 Do not hasten to bid me adieu
 Just remember the Red River Valley
 And the cowboy who loved you so true
 </i>
Do you think of the valley you’re leaving
Oh how lonely, how lonesome ‘twill be
Do you think of the fond hearts you’re grieving
And the pain you are causing to me

I’ve been thinking a long time, my darling
Of the sweet words you never would say
Now alas for my fond heart is breaking
For they say you are going away

They will bury me where you have wandered
On the hills where the daffodils grow
When you’re gone from the Red River Valley
For I can’t live without you, I know
