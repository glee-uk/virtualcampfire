I thought I heard the old man say
<i> Leave her, Johnny, leave her</i>
Tomorrow you will get your pay
<i> And it’s time for us to leave her</i>
 <i>
 Leave her, Johnny, leave her
 Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her</i>
 For the voyage is done and the winds don’t blow
<i> And it’s time for us to leave her </i>

It’s a long hard pull to the next pay day
<i> And it’s time for us to leave her</i>
<i> Leave her, Johnny, leave her</i>
<i></i> Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her</i>
 It’s a long hard pull to the next pay day
 <i> And it’s time for us to leave her </i>

The captain was bad but the mate was worse...
He could blow you down with a sigh and a curse...

<i> Leave her, Johnny, leave her</i>
<i> Oh, leave her, Johnny, leave her</i>
 He could blow you down with a sigh and a curse
 And it’s time for us to leave her

And a dollar a day is a Jack Shite’s pay...
When it’s pump all night and work all day...
Now the rats are all gone and we the crew...
Oh it’s time by Christ that we went too...
Well it’s pump or drown, the old man said...
Or else by Christ we’ll all be dead...
I thought I heard the old man say...
Just one more pump and then belay...
