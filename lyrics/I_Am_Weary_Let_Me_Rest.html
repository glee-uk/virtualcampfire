<h1>
 I Am Weary Let Me Rest
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Kiss me, Mother, kiss your daughter
Lay my head upon your breast
Throw your loving arms around me
I am weary, let me rest

Seems the light is swiftly fading
Pride or sins they do now show
I am standing by the river
Angels wait to take me home

Kiss me, Mother, kiss your daughter
See the pain upon my brow
While you’ll soon be with the angels
Fate has doomed my future now

Through the years you’ve always loved me
And my life you’ve tried to save
But now I shall slumber sweetly
In a deep and lonely grave

Kiss me, Mother, kiss your darling
Lay my head upon your breast
Throw your loving arms around me
I am weary, let me rest
I am weary, let me rest
