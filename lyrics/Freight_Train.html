 <i>
 Freight train, freight train runs so fast
 Freight train, freight train runs so fast
 Please don’t tell what train I’m on
 So they won’t know where I’m gone
 </i>
When I die lord bury me deep
Way down on old Chestnut street
So I can hear old number nine
As she comes rolling by

When I am dead and in my grave
No more good times ere I crave
Put a stone at my head and feet
And tell them all that I’m gone to sleep
