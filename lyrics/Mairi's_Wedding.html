 Mairi’s Wedding

 <i>
 Step we gaily, on we go, heel for heel, and toe for toe
 Arm in arm and on we go, all for Mairi’s wedding
 </i>
Over hill ways up and down
Myrtle green and bracken brown
Past the sheiling through the town

All for sake of Mairi
Plenty herring, plenty meal
Plenty peat to fill her creel
Plenty bonny bairns as weel
That’s the toast for Mairi

Cheeks as bright as rowans are
Brighter far than any star
Fairest of them all by far
Is my darling Mairi
