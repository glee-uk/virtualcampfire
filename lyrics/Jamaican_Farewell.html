Down the way where the nights are gay
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top
I took a trip on a sailing ship
And when I reached Jamaica, I made a stop
 <i>
 But I’m sad to say, I’m on my way
 Won’t be back for many a day
 My heart is down, my head is turning around
 I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
 </i>

Sounds of laughter everywhere
And the dancing girls swing to and fro
I must declare that my heart is there
Though I’ve been from Maine down to Mexico

But I’m sad to say, I’m on my way
Won’t be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town

Down at the market you can hear
Ladies cry out as on their heads they bear
Husky rice and salt fish are nice
And the rum is fine any time of year

But I’m sad to say, I’m on my way
Won’t be back for many a day
My heart is down, my head is turning around
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston Town
