 Hall and Tow

<pre>
Take the scorn to wear a horn
It was the crisp when you were born
Your father’s father wore it
And your father wore it too
 <i>
 Hal and Tow, jolly rumbelow
 We were up long before the day-oh
 To welcome in the summer, to welcome in the May-oh
 For summer is a coming in and winter’s gone away-oh
 </i>
What happened to the Spaniards
That made so great a boast-oh
Why they shall eat the feathered goose
And we shall eat the roast-oh

Robin Hood and Little John
Have all come to the Fair-oh
And we will to the merry greenwood
To hunt the buck and hare-oh
God bless St Mary, Moses and all the poor and mite-oh
And send us peace to England
Send peace by day and night-oh
