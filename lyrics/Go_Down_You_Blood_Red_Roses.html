 Go down you blood red roses

<pre>
Gather round you sailors and listen to me
 <i>Go down you blood red roses, go down!</i
Ne’er take a young girl on your knee
 <i>Go down you blood red roses, go down!</i>
 <i>
 Oh you pinks and posies
 Go down you blood red roses, go down!
 </i>

Them Liverpool girls ain’t got no comb...
They comb their hair with a kipper backbone...

The wind blows cold around Cape Horn...
And there ain’t no girls to keep you warm...

When I was young and in my prime...
I took them pretty girls nine at a time...

But now I’m old and getting grey...
I can hardly manage one a day...
