Work Song

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Breaking rocks out here on the chain gang
Breaking rocks and serving my time
Breaking rocks out here on the chain gang
Cause I been convicted of crime
 <i>
 Hold it steady right there while I hit it
 Well I reckon that ought to get it
 I’ve been working, working
 But I still got so terribly far to go
 </i>

I committed crime Lord of needing
Crime of being hungry and poor
I left the grocery store man breathing
When he caught me robbing his store

I heard the judge say “Five years labour
On the chain-gang you’re gonna go”
I heard the judge say “Five years labour”
I heard my old man scream “Lordy, no!”

Gonna see my sweet honey baby
Gonna break this chain off the rock
Gonna lay down somewhere shady
Lord it sure is hot in the sun
