 Lord of the Dance

<pre>
I danced in the morning when the world was begun
I danced in the moon and the stars and the sun
I came down from heaven and I danced on earth
At Bethlehem I had my birth
<i>
 Dance, then, wherever you may be
 I am the Lord of the dance said he
 And I’ll lead you all, wherever you may be
 And I’ll lead you all in the dance said he
</i>
I danced for the Scribe and the Pharisee
They would not dance and they would not follow me
I danced for the fishermen, for James and John
They came with me and the dance went on

I danced on the Sabbath and I cured the lame
The holy people said it was a shame
They whipped and they stripped and they hung me high
And left me there on a cross to die

I danced on a Friday when the sky turned black
It’s hard to dance with the devil on your back
They buried my body and they thought I’d gone
But I am the dance and I still go on

They cut me down but I leapt up high
For I am the dance that will never, never die
I’ll live in you if you’ll live in me
I am the Lord of the Dance, said he
