What shall we do with the drunken sailor
What shall we do with the drunken sailor
What shall we do with the drunken sailor
Early in the morning

 Hooray and up she rises
 Hooray and up she rises
 Hooray and up she rises
 Early in the morning

Lock him in the cabin with the captain’s daughter...
Early in the morning

Throw him in the longboat ‘til he’s sober...
Early in the morning

Shave his belly with a rusty razor...
Early in the morning

Put him in the scupers with a hose pipe on him...
Early in the morning

Put him in the guardroom till he gets sober...
Early in the morning

That’s what we’ll do with the drunken sailor...
Early in the morning
