<pre>
In a neat little town they called Belfast
Apprenticed to trade I was bound
And many an hour’s sweet happiness
Have I spent in that neat little town
A bad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from me friends and relations
Betrayed by the Black Velvet Band
<i>
Her eyes they shone like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band
</i>
I took a stroll down Broadway
Meaning not long for to stay
When who should I see but a pretty fair maid
Come tripping along the pathway
She was both fair and handsome
Her neck it was just like a swan’s
And her hair it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
And a gentleman passing us by
I knew she meant a doing for him
By the look in her roguish black eye
His watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into me hand
And the very next thing that I said was
Bad luck to the Black Velvet Band

Before the Judge and Jury
Next morning I had to appear
The Judge he said to me: Young man
Your case it is proved clear
I’ll give you seven years penal servitude
To be spent right away from the land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the Black Velvet Band

So come all you jolly young fellows
A warning take by me
When you are out on the town, me lads
Beware of the pretty colleens
They’ll treat you to strong drink, me boys
Till you are not able to stand
And the very next thing that you know is
You’ve landed in Van Diemens Land
