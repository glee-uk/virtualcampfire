The British police are the best in the world
I don’t believe one of those stories I’ve heard
About them raiding our clubs for no reason at all
Lining the customers up by the wall
Pulling out people, knocking them down
Resisting arrest as they’re kicked on the ground
Raiding our houses, calling us queer
I don’t believe that sort of thing happens here
 <i>
 Sing if you’re glad to be gay
 Sing if you’re happy that way, Hey!
 Sing if you’re glad to be gay
 Sing if you’re happy that way
 </i>
Pictures of naked young women are fun
In Titbits and Playboy, page three of the Sun
There’s no nudes in Gay News, our one magazine
But they still found excuses to call it obscene

Read how disgusting we are in the press
The Telegraph, People and Sunday Express
Molesters of children, corruptors of youth
It’s there in the papers..... it must be the truth

 Sing if you’re glad to be gay
 Sing if you’re happy that way, Hey!
 Sing if you’re glad to be gay
 Sing if you’re happy that way

And don’t try to kid us that if you’re discreet
You’re perfectly safe as you walk down the street
You don’t have to mince or to make bitchy remarks
To get beaten unconscious and left in the dark
I had a friend who was gentle and short
He was lonely one evening, he went for a walk
Queerbashers caught him and kicked in his teeth
He was only hospitalised for a week

And sit back and watch as they close down our clubs
Arrest us for meeting and raid all our pubs
Make sure your boyfriend’s at least twenty one
So only your friends and your brothers get done
Lie to your workmates, lie to your folks
Put down the queens, tell anti-queer jokes
Gay Lib’s ridiculous, join their laughter
The buggers are legal now... what more are they after?
