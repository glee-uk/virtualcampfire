 The House of the Rising Sun

There is a house in New Or-leans
They call the Rising Sun
It’s been the ruin of many a poor boy/girl
And God I know I’m one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed my new blue jeans
My father was a gamblin’ man
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a gun
And the only time he’s satisfied
Is when he’s dead and gone

Now Mother tell my sister
Not to do what I have done
Spend your life in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun

With one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I’m going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

I’m going back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I’m going back to end my life
In the house of the Rising Sun
