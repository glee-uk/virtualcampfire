Oh Lord, won’t you buy a Mercedes-Benz?
My friends all drive Porsches I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends

Oh Lord, won’t you buy a Mercedes-Benz?
O Lord, won’t you buy me a colour TV?
Dialing for Dollars is trying to find me
I’ll wait for delivery each day until three
O Lord, won’t you buy me a colour TV?

Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a night on the town?
I’m countin’ on you, Lord, please don’t let me down
Prove that you love me and buy the next round
Oh Lord, won’t you buy me a night on the town?

Oh Lord, won’t you buy a Mercedes-Benz?
My friends all drive Porsches I must make amends
Worked hard all my lifetime, no help from my friends
Oh Lord, won’t you buy a Mercedes-Benz?
