 May The Circle Be Unbroken

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
I was standing at my window
On a cold and cloudy day
When I saw a hearse come rolling
Oh to carry my sweetheart away

 May the circle be unbroken
 By and by, Lord, by and by
 There’s a better home a-waiting
 In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Oh I told the undertaker
Undertaker, please drive slow
‘Cause this lady that you’re holding
Oh I hate to see her go

I will follow close behind her
Try to hold up and be brave
But I could not hold my sorrow
As they laid her in her grave
