 One More Pull

<pre>
It’s been a long time since you’ve seen her
Could have been three years or more
Will she be waiting when we dock, boy
Or like others, will she be gone?
 <i>
 And it’s one more pull boys, that will do boys
 Soon we’ll draw alongside
 Hoist her upwards, swing her inboard
 For the journey’s nearly done
 </i>
Well you’re looking mighty fine, boy
All dressed in your number ones
You’ve scrounged a new blade from the purser
To scrape that bum-fluff from off your chin

And we’ll make fast those bow and stern lines
As you scuttle down the gangway
If she’s waiting there, just kiss her
Turn around, give us a smile.

For we too will go ashore soon
Get drunk in the clubs and bars,
Stagger homeward, pockets empty
Like so many nights before.

For a man may have a wife, boy
And a man may take a mistress
But a sailor has his ship, boy
And his mistress it is the sea
 <i>
 And it’s one more pull boys, that will do boys
 Soon we’ll draw alongside
 Hoist her upwards, swing her inboard
 For the journey now is done
 </i>
