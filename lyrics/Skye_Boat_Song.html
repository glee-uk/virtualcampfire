 Skye Boat Song
</h1>

<pre>
 <i>
 Speed bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing
 Onward the sailors cry
 Carry the lad that’s born to be king
 Over the sea to Skye
 </i>
Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar
Thunderclaps rend the air
Baffled, our foes stand by the shore
Follow they will not dare

Many’s the lad fought on that day
Well the claymore could wield
When the night came silently lay
Dead on Culloden’s field

Though the waves leap, soft shall he sleep
Ocean’s a royal bed
Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep
Watch by your weary head

Burned are our homes, exile and death
Scattered the loyal men
Yet e’er the sword cool in the sheath
Charlie will come again
