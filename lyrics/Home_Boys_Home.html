<pre>
Oh who wouldn’t be a sailor boy a-sailing on the main?
To gain the good will of his captain is to blame
For he went ashore now one evening for to be
And that was the beginning of the whole calamity
 <i>
 And it’s home, boys, home
 Home I’d like to be
 Home for a while in me own country
 Where the oak and the ash and the bonny rowan tree
 Are all a-blooming freely in the north country
    </i>
Now I asked her for a handkerchief to tie around me head
And likewise for a candle for to light me up to bed
She tended to me needs just like a young maid ought to do
So then I says to her, Why don’t you jump in with me too?

Oh she jumped into bed now taking no alarm
Thinking a young sailor lad to her could do no harm
I hugged her, I kissed her the whole night long
Till she wished the short night had been seven years long

Oh well early next morning the sailor lad arose
And into Mary’s apron poured a pocket full of gold
Saying “Take this my dear for the mischief I have done
For tonight I fear I’ve left you with a daughter or a son”

Now if it be a girl child we’ll send her out to nurse
With silver in her pocket and gold in her purse
And if it be a boy child, give him the jacket blue,
And send him up the rigging like his daddy used to do

Come listen all you fair maids take this advice from me
Never let a sailor lad an inch above your knee
For I trusted one and he beguiled me
And he left me with a pair of twins to dandle on me knee
