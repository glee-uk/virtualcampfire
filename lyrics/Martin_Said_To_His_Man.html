 Martin Said To His Man
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Martin said to his man, “Fie, man, fie”
Martin said to his man, “Who’s the fool now?”
Martin said to his man, “Fill thou the cup and I the can”
 <i>
 Thou hast well drunken man
 Who’s the fool now?
 </i>

I saw the man in the moon, fie, man fie
I saw the man in the moon, who’s the fool now?
I saw the man in the moon, sliding down St Peter’s shoen

I saw the mouse chase the cat...
...and saw the cheese eat the rat

I saw the maid milk the bull...
...every stroke a bucketful

I saw the hare chase the hounds...
...forty miles above the ground

I saw the flea heave a tree...
...forty leagues across the sea

I saw the sheep shearing corn
...and saw the cuckold blow his horn
