 Bring Us in Hot Tea

<pre>
Bring us in no rum, for that’s a drink for sailors
But bring us in hot tea, for that will never fail us
 <i>
 So bring us in hot tea, hot tea
 And bring us in hot tea
 That’s what the blessed ladies make
 So bring us in hot tea
 </i>
Bring us in no cider, for that will send us reeling
But bring us in hot tea, Earl Gray, Ceylon or Darjeeling

Bring us in no schnaps, for they are made with brandy
But bring us in hot tea, and a strainer would be handy

Bring us in no home brew; we’re not inclined to risk it
But bring us in hot tea,oh,and all right, just one biscuit

Bring us in no gin, for that was mother’s ruin
But bring us in hot tea, and put a lump or two in

Bring us in no white wine, for that don’t cure no hot thirst
But bring us in hot tea, and be sure to warm the pot first
