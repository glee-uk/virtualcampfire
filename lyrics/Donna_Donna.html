On a wagon bound for market             
There's a calf with a mournful eye.     
High above him there's a swallow        
Winging swiftly through the sky         
                                        
Chorus                                  
How the winds are laughing              
They laugh with all their might,        
Laugh so loud the whole day through     
And half the summer's night.            
Donna, donna, donna, donna,             
Donna, donna, donna, don.               
Donna, donna, donna, donna,             
Donna, donna, donna, don.               
                                        
Stop complaining, said the farmer,      
Who told you a calf to be.              
Why don't you have wings to fly with
Like the swallow so proud and free?    
                                        
Calves are easily bound and slaughtered,
Never knowing the reasons why           
But whoever treasures freedom           
Like the swallow must leam to fly.
