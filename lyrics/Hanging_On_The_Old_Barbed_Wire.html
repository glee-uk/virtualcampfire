If you want to see the general, I know where he is
I know where he is, I know where he is
If you want to see the general, I know where he is
He’s pinning another medal on his chest
I saw him, I saw him
Pinning another medal on his chest (I saw him)
Pinning another medal on his chest

If you want to see the Colonel, I know where he is
I know where he is, I know where he is
If you want to see the Colonel, I know where he is
He’s sitting in comfort stuffing his bloody face
I saw him, I saw him
Sitting in comfort stuffing his bloody face (I saw him)
Sitting in comfort stuffing his bloody face

If you want to see the Major...
He’s home again on seven days’ leave...
If you want to see the Sergeant...
He’s drinking all the company’s rum...
If you want to see the Corporal...
He’s drunk upon the dug-out floor...

If you want to see the Private, I know where he is
I know where he is, I know where he is
If you want to see the Private, I know where he is
He’s hanging on the old barbed wire
I saw him, I saw him
Hanging on the old barbed wire (I saw him)
Hanging on the old barbed wire
