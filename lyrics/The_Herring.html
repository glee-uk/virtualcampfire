<pre>
What’ll I do with my herring’s head?
Oh what’ll you do with your herring’s head?
I make it into loaves of bread
Herring’s head - loaves of bread
 <i>
 And all manner of things
 Of all the fish that swim in the sea
 The herring is the fish for me
 Away the day, away the day
 My Hinnie oh
 </i>
What’ll I do with my herring’s eyes?
Oh what’ll you do with your herring’s eyes?
I make them into puddings and pies
Herring’s eyes - puddings and pies
Herring’s head - loaves of bread
Herring’s tail - barrel of ale

Herring’s guts - pair of boots
Herring’s scales - ship with sails
Herring’s fins - needles and pins
Herring’s back - fishing smack
Herring’s gills - window sills
 <i>
 And all manner of things
 Of all the fish that swim in the sea
 The herring is the fish for me
 Away the day, away the day
 My Hinnie oh
 </i>
Oh what do you think of such a thing?
Haven’t I done well with my bonny herring?
