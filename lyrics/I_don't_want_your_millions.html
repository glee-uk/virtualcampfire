 <i>
 I don’t want your millions, Mister
 I don’t want your diamond ring
 All I want is the right to live, Mister
 Give me back my job again
 </i>
I don’t want your Rolls Royce, Mister
I don’t want your pleasure yacht
All I want is food for my babies
Give to me my old job back

We worked to build this country, Mister
While you enjoyed a life of ease
You’ve stolen all that we built, Mister
Now our children starve and freeze

Think me dumb if you wish, Mister
Call me green or blue or red
This one thing I know for sure, Mister
My hungry children must be fed

Take the two opposing parties
No difference in them I can see
But with a Farmer Labour party
We could set the people free
