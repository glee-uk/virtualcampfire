<pre>
Am
Every morning at seven o’clock
 E7
There are twenty tarriers drilling at the rock
 Am
And the boss come along and he said, Keep still
 E7
And come down heavy on the cast-iron drill
 Am E7 Am
 And drill, ye tarriers, drill
 G Am
 And drill, ye tarriers, drill
 C
 For it’s work all day for the sugar in yer tay
 E7
 Down behind the old railway
 Am E Am
 And drill, ye tarriers, drill. And blast - and fire!
Our new foreman is Jimmy McCann
By God he is a blame mean man
One day a premature blast went off
And a mile in the air went big Jim Gough
When next pay day came around
Jim Gough a dollar short was found
When he asked “What for?” came this reply
You were docked for the time you were up in the sky
Our boss is a good man down to the ground
And he married a lady six feet round
She bakes good bread and she bakes it well
But she bakes it hard as the  holes in Hell
