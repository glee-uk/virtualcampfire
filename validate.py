# Compare the Google sheet data with the files

# The Google sheet is at:
#  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Beh2H4Hxyz5OTgBWB4afx0h_gpxcHu785-k6Gbtc0lI/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet=Songs
# save it as songs.csv
#
# index.txt is a list of the mp3 files in the mp3 directory


# If song files have not been added to spreadsheet then the following worked:

# python validate.py > missing.csv
# cat missing.csv >> songs.csv
# sort songs.csv > songs_sorted.csv
# Edit songs_sorted.csv to move first line back to top
# mv songs_sorted.csv songs.csv
# Upload to Google Sheets and overwrite current sheet.
# It might be better to keep this file away from the rest of the human edited sheet.
